### HTML to PDF Glide Plugin (Now with Browser-based Print Capabilities!)

This plugin allows you to preview and save HTML as downloadable and printable PDFs. This code is forked from [Loqode's html2pdf](https://github.com/Loqode/html2pdf) and simply adds a "Print" feature so that it can be implemented in instances where you want to print a document without first needing to save it and open it in another app, for instance when printing receipts at Point of Sale (POS).

1. In an experimental code column, paste the following URL: https://drockhollaback.github.io/html2pdfprint
2. Then on your layout screen, add a web-embed component and select this column as the source.
3. Viola!

If you want to level-up your Glide skills for free, you really should head to [Loqode.com](https://loqode.com). Marco is a genius, not to mention a saint for putting all of his knowledge out there for free to the world, so if you don't take this advice, it's your loss  ðŸš€
